# Spark  
### The Big Data Problem
* In the past, computers became faster every year as the speed of processors increased. These processors could run more tasks per second than the previous one's and as a result applications also became faster gradually without any changes needed to their code. This led to a large ecosystem of applications which were mostly run on a single processor.
Over a period of time, the computations have become larger and huge volumes of data was generated and the trends of improved processor could not scale up to the demand and finally in 2005 this trend has stopped due to hard limits in heat dissipation and a major switch took place where developers started adding more parallel CPU cores with all running at the same speed.
The next step was to modify the applications to add paralellism in order to run faster and set a stage for programming models with a unified computing engine such as **Apache Spark**.
