### The Big Data Problem
In the past, computers became faster every year as the speed of processors increased. These processors could run more tasks per second than the previous one's and as a result applications also became faster gradually without any changes needed to their code. This led to a large ecosystem of applications which were mostly run on a single processor.
Over a period of time, the computations have become larger and huge volumes of data was generated
